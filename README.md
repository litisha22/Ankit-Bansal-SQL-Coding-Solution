## ðŸ“˜ Ankit-Bansal-SQL-Coding-Solutions

This repository contains a structured collection of **SQL assignments and solutions** covering beginner to intermediate SQL concepts. Each folder represents one day of learning, with exercises focused on a specific set of topics. This was created as part of a structured learning program to build real-world SQL query-writing skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Each folder includes:

* **Assignment questions** (`.txt`)
* **Solutions** (`.sql`)
